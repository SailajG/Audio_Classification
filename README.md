# Audio_Classification

- Audio classification by implementing a machine learning pipeline
using MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset. Collected and cleaned the
data following to which, feature extraction was performed and our
integrated machine learning model was evaluated.

- Audio classification by extracting audio features including MFCCs,
spectrograms, and chroma features using UrbanSound8K dataset.
Trained a deep learning model (CNN/RNN) achieving maximum
accuracy on the dataset.
